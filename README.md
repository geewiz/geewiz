# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Jochen.

I'm the CTO and co-founder of [freistil IT](https://www.freistil.it), a distributed team of web operations experts. I live with my family near Dublin, Ireland.

## Fun facts

- I build and collect mechanical keyboards. At the moment, I own about 10.
- I love old computers and own a working replica of a PDP-11, a 1970's era minicomputer.
- I once contemplated becoming a Catholic priest, but love intervened.
- Over the decades, I've coded in BASIC, Assembler (6502, 68000, PDP-11), Clipper/dBase, Pascal, Forth, C, Prolog, Ada, C++, Perl, PHP, Bash, Javascript and Ruby.
