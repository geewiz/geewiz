# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Jochen.

I'm the CTO and co-founder of [freistil IT](https://www.freistil.it), a distributed team of web operations experts. I live with my family near Dublin, Ireland.

At [Monospace Mentor](https://monospacementor.com), I help software engineers level up in DevOps and reliability engineering.

## Fun facts

- Over the decades, I've coded in BASIC, Assembler (6502, 68000, PDP-11), Clipper/dBase, Pascal, Forth, C, Prolog, Ada, C++, Perl, PHP, Bash, Javascript and Ruby.
- I own far too many mechanical keyboards.
- I love old computers and own a working replica of a PDP-11, a 1970's era minicomputer that was used to develop the UNIX operating system.
